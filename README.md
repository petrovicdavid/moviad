## Project Objective

MoViAD is an Open Source library for easy and modular Visual Anomaly Detection, built for industrial and research purposes. 
The library contains some State-of-the-Art models with their trainers, standard datasets, evaluator for calculating standard metrics, and a feature extractor.
The library structure is totally modular, allowing an easy isolation of the components needed for your project. 
The library will support different scenarios (see also below):
* Unsupervised anomaly detection ✅
* Contaminated anomaly detection ✅
* Semi-supervised anomaly detection 🚧 (Work in progress)
* Few shot anomaly detection 🚧 (Work in progress)
* Continual anomaly detection 🚧 (Work in progress)


## How to use the library

The library follows this structure:
- inside the <code>/models/model_name</code> directory is present the code of anomaly detection models
- inside the <code>/trainers</code> directory is present the code for training the anomaly detection models
- inside the <code>/datasets</code> directory is present the code for the anomaly detection datasets that must be used
- inside the <code>/utilies</code> directory is present the code for anomaly detection utilities

## Execution example

Inside the <code>/main_scripts</code> directory are present some execution scripts for training and testing the AD models. 

For example, for training patchcore: 

```bash
python main_scripts/main_patchcore.py --mode train --dataset_path /home/datasets/mvtec --category pill --backbone mobilenet_v2 --ad_layers features.4 features.7 features.10 --device cuda:0 --save_path ./patch.pt 
```

For every main script all its parameters are documented.

**Scenarios**

- Unsupervised: standard VAD scenario where the model is trained on a dataset of normal samples and evaluated on a dataset of normal and abnormal samples.
- Contaminated: model trained on a dataset of both normal and abnormal samples, a certain percentage of abnormal samples (train set contamination).
- Semi-supervised: model trained on a dataset of mostly normal samples with a small percentage of labeled abnormal samples, leveraging both types of data to improve anomaly detection performance.
- Few-shot: model trained on a dataset of normal samples and a few abnormal samples which are labeled.
- Continual: the model is trained on a specific subset, called task, and then updated with new tasks. The model should be able to perform well on all seen tasks.
